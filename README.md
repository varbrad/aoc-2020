# ☃️ Advent of Code 2020 ☃️

Hey! This year I am doing all the [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020) challenges in [Golang](https://golang.org/)!

My experience with the language is fairly minimal, so if you notice me doing anything dumb/inefficient in my solutions, please feel do let me know either on [Twitter @varbrad](https://twitter.com/varbrad) or by raising a [pull request right here on GitHub](https://github.com/varbrad/aoc-2020/compare) and let me know what I did wrong or could improve!

## Running the code

> The commands below require your current working directory to be in the repository root, e.g. `~/dev/aoc-2020`, also most of the puzzle input paths will only work if you are in that directory.

### Run a solution

Use the `go run` command followed by a relative path to the day;

e.g.

```zsh
go run ./day1
```

This will run both Part 1 & 2 (if it exists)

### Running tests

Use the `go test` command followed by a relative path to the day;

e.g.

```zsh
go test ./day1
```

Alternatively, you can run _all_ of tests in the entire repository;

```zsh
go test ./...
```
