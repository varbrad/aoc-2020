# ☃️ Advent of Code 2020 ☃️

Hey! This year I am doing all the [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020) challenges in [Golang](https://golang.org/)!

My experience with the language is fairly minimal, so if you notice me doing anything dumb/inefficient in my solutions, please feel do let me know either on [Twitter @varbrad](https://twitter.com/varbrad) or by raising a [pull request right here on GitHub](https://github.com/varbrad/aoc-2020/compare) and let me know what I did wrong or could improve!
